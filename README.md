Hey There Future Developer ðŸ‘‹ if you are new in Acode plugin Development like me let's work Together. This Repository is focused on building a Acode simple plugin by using minimum files or complexity. Always remember its for beginners.

# Necessary Files *
1. `main.js`
2. `plugin.json`
3. 
4. 


# Files Explanation 

**1. Main.js**
well This is The most important file which contains our main plugin code. in this file we have some important functions and variables which are necessary for a successful install

1. `init()` function
2. `destroy()` function
3. `setPluginInit()` function
4. `setPluginUnmount()` function 

All the above listed Function are the mendetory functions `setPluginInit()` and `setPluginUnmount()` are defined inside a class named `acode` so we can call them using `acode.FunctionName()` These are Acode's inbuilt function and we just need to call them with actual arguments if you wanna explore more about those functions just click <a href=""> me </a> but if you are bigner 
I'll suggest you to use the files instead of exploring Documentations to avoid any confusion build a basic plugin and then explore according to the problems.
